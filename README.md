## 📉 The Dunning-Kruger Effect

The **Dunning-Kruger effect** is a cognitive bias where people with **low ability at a task overestimate their ability**. In simple terms:  
> **The less you know, the more you *think* you know.**

🔺 At the peak of this curve lies the notorious **Mount Stupid** —  
A place where confidence is high, but knowledge is suspiciously low.

## ⛰️ What's Mount Stupid?

Mount Stupid is that deceptive peak where you feel like a Python ninja because you've done a few tutorials and built some projects...

...but when real-world problems show up, you realize:
> "Wait a minute. Do I even *know* Python?"

## 🧠 Why This Bootcamp?

I *feel* like I know Python pretty well.  
I’ve done tutorials, solved exercises, even built some things — but deep down, I know there's more to it. This bootcamp is my **reality check** — a 30-day challenge designed to:

- ✅ Test what I really know
- ✅ Improve my problem-solving and logic
- ✅ Simulate real-world scenarios
- ✅ Catch blind spots before they catch me

This is a **personal climb** down from Mount Stupid and up the real **Slope of Enlightenment**.
