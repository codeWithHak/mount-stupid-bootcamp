Write a Python program that:

Takes input from the user:

A start number (e.g., 1)

An end number (e.g., 50)

A Fizz divisor (e.g., 3)

A Buzz divisor (e.g., 5)

Prints output from start to end:

If the number is divisible by Fizz divisor only ‚Üí print "Fizz"

If divisible by Buzz divisor only ‚Üí print "Buzz"

If divisible by both ‚Üí print "FizzBuzz"

Otherwise ‚Üí print the number

üîç Example
Let's say the user inputs:

start = 1
end = 15
fizz_div = 3
buzz_div = 5

Your program should print:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
