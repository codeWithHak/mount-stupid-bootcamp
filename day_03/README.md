# 💡 Day 3 Challenge: “The Unique Collector”

## 🧩 Problem Statement:
### Write a Python program that takes a list of items (strings or numbers) from the user — possibly with duplicates — and then:

### Returns the list of unique items, preserving the original input order.

### Tells the user:

- How many total items they entered

- How many were duplicates

- How many are unique


## 🧪 Sample:

### Input:

Enter items separated by commas: apple, banana, apple, mango, banana, kiwi

### Output:

Unique items in order: ['apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'kiwi']
Total items entered: 6
Unique items: 4
Duplicates removed: 2
